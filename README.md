A ROM data reading tool for the NTSC version of Phantasy Star IV.

This is currently in an alpha stage. Many things are not worked out at the moment.<br/>
Not all palettes and tile maps have been found or applied correctly.<br/>
Do not attempt to use the Map screen, it will most likely crash.<br/>
The ps4_rom_map.asm file is what I have found thus far in the rom.<br/>
The built in Data Verify tool is used to define what compression has been used in a byte range.<br/>
