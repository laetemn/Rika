A ROM data reading tool for the NTSC version of Phantasy Star IV.

This is currently in an alpha stage. Many things are not worked out at the moment. 
Not all palettes and tile maps have been found or applied correctly. 
Do not attempt to use the Map screen, it will most likely crash. 
The ps4_rom_map.asm file is what I have found thus far in the rom. 
The built in Data Verify tool is used to define what compression has been used in a byte range.
